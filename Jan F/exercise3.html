        <span> it's been a long time
since we had this mood
with potential and power
let's not be rude</span> there's sooo much that we can do it's just a matter of how & when we learn to do . .learn what? .coding. .what? .programming. THE CODING SONG title .. .. first switch the computer ON in a group or if alone every problem
        will be gone now there is no need to mourn put everything else aside open editor, let's write everything will be alright leave just your old fright few rules, syntax, just don't loose statements if else switch and loop stick-to-the-language that
        you choose procedural or the OOP algo first with a cool mind read code, write code all you find try out lot, just don't grieve there's no wonder, you can't achieve there's no wonder, you can't achieve wonders you can achieve what wonders superpowers
        (after compiling though) lately i've been, i've been learning C dreaming about the things that we could be lately, i've been, i've been coding hard sooner or later but we will be super stars. lately i'm on, i'm on coding spree there is so much
        to learn & so much to see lately i am, i am looking far with the power of coding we'll be super stars. Precious is the skill you earn Powers are the lessons you learnt New languages & new puns new topics as you learn. Few more Days & few more
        runs few techniques & you are done from your home or on a run freelance coding just for fun. get cool job at google or SUN / CERN spend with joy the money you earn. possibilities are really endless... lately i've been, i've been learning C dreaming
        about the things that we could be lately, i've been, i've been coding hard sooner or later but we will be super stars. lately i'm on, i'm on coding spree there is so much to learn & so much to see lately i am, i am looking far with the power of
        coding we'll be, we'll be super stars. . . .Programming is a super power. & it's super fun. so, Just Choose any language & START CODING TODAY.
