        <span> it's been a long time<br>
        since we had this mood<br>
        with potential and power<br>
        let's not be rude<br> there's sooo much<br> that we can do<br> it's just a matter of how<br> & when we learn to
        do<br>
        <br> learn what?<br> coding.
        <br> what?
        <br> programming.
        <br> THE <br> CODING SONG title<br> ..
        <br> ..

        <br> first switch the computer ON<br> in a group or if alone<br> every problem will be gone<br> now there is no
        need to mourn<br>
        <br> put everything else aside<br> open editor, let's write<br> everything will be alright<br> leave just your
        old fright<br>
        <br> few rules, syntax, just don't loose<br> statements if else switch and loop<br> stick-to-the-language that
        you choose<br> procedural or the OOP<br>
        <br> algo first with a cool mind <br> read code, write code all you find<br> try out lot, just don't grieve<br>
        there's no wonder, you can't achieve<br>
        <br> there's no wonder, you can't achieve<br> wonders you can achieve<br>
        <br> what wonders<br> superpowers
        <br>

        <br> lately i've been, i've been learning C<br> dreaming about the things that we could be<br> lately, i've
        been, i've been coding hard<br> sooner or later but<br> we will be super stars.<br>
        <br> lately i'm on, i'm on coding spree<br> there is so much to learn & so much to see<br> lately i am, i am
        looking far<br> with the power of coding<br> we'll be super stars.<br>
        <br>
        <br> Precious is <br> the skill you earn<br> Powers are <br> the lessons you learnt<br>
        <br> New languages <br> & new puns<br> new topics <br> as you learn.<br>
        <br> Few more Days <br> & few more runs<br> few techniques <br> & you are done<br>
        <br> from your home<br> or on a run<br> freelance coding<br> just for fun.<br>

        <br> possibilities are really endless...<br>
        <br> lately i've been, i've been learning C<br> dreaming about the things that we could be<br> lately, i've
        been, i've been coding hard<br> sooner or later but<br> we will be super stars.<br>
        <br> lately i'm on, i'm on coding spree<br> there is so much to learn & so much to see<br> lately i am, i am
        looking far<br> with the power of coding<br> we'll be, we'll be super stars.<br>
        <br>
