    <h1> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qk8gXH9_9c">Coding Superstar</h1> </a>

        <div> it's been a long time<br> since we had this mood <br>with potential and power let's not be rude</div>
        <div>there's sooo much that we can do <br> it's just a matter of how <br>& when we learn to do</div>
        <div> what? .coding. .what? .programming. </div>
        <div> THE CODING SONG title</div><br>
        <div> switch the computer ON<br>in a group or if alone<br> every problem will be gone<br> now there is no need to mourn </div>
        <div>put everything else aside open editor<br> let's write everything will<span> be alright</span> leave just your old fright</div>
        <div>
            <p>rules, syntax, just don't <span>loose statements</span> if else switch and loop</p> stick-to-the-language<br> that you choose procedural or the OOP</div>
